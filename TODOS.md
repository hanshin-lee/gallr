# TODOS

Last updated: 2026-03-27 (from /plan-ceo-review)

## P1 — Post-Launch

### Push Notifications
Weekly "N new exhibitions near you" push via FCM (Android) + APNs (iOS). Primary retention mechanism. Needs server-side trigger (Cloud Function or GAS extension). Depends on basic analytics being in place.
- Effort: M (human) → S (CC: ~1 day)
- Context: Design doc identifies retention as key initiative. Without a trigger, users forget to open the app.

## P2 — Quality of Life

### Open in Maps
Button on ExhibitionDetailScreen to open Apple Maps / Naver Map / Google Maps with exhibition coordinates. Completes the discover → save → navigate → visit loop.
- Effort: S (CC: ~30 min)
- Context: Latitude/longitude already in data model but unused on detail screen.

### Featured/Editor's Pick Badges
Show visual badges on detail screen and cards for featured / editor's pick exhibitions.
- Effort: S (CC: ~30 min)
- Context: `isFeatured` and `isEditorsPick` fields exist in data model.

## P2 — Quality of Life (continued)

### DESIGN.md — Codify the Design System
Formalize gallr's design system (colors, typography, spacing, component patterns, accent usage rules) in a DESIGN.md file. Currently the design system lives only in Kotlin code (GallrColors.kt, GallrTypography.kt). Every new screen requires reading source code to understand visual rules. GallrAccent has explicit usage rules (only for CTA, active indicator, interaction feedback) in code comments but not in a design doc.
- Effort: S (CC: ~15 min)
- Context: No prerequisites. Can be done anytime. Run `/design-consultation` for a thorough approach, or extract directly from GallrColors.kt + GallrTypography.kt.

## P3 — Technical Debt

### ViewModel Splitting
Split TabsViewModel (15+ StateFlows) into domain-specific ViewModels (ExhibitionViewModel, FilterViewModel, MapViewModel). Cleaner separation, easier testing.
- Effort: M (human) → S (CC: ~2 hours)
- Context: Single VM is manageable now but approaching god-object threshold.

### Migrate ExhibitionApiClient to supabase-kt Postgrest
Replace the raw Ktor ExhibitionApiClient with supabase-kt's Postgrest module for exhibition fetching. Eliminates dual HTTP client tech debt (two Ktor instances = two connection pools, two configs). ExhibitionApiClient.kt is 49 lines doing `GET /exhibitions?select=*`. Equivalent supabase-kt: `supabase.from("exhibitions").select()`. Migration is ~30 lines.
- Effort: S (CC: ~15 min)
- Depends on: Social layer Phase 1 complete (supabase-kt already in project)
- Context: Two Ktor engines with potentially different versions cause subtle runtime bugs. The dual-client approach is accepted tech debt for the social layer launch but should be resolved in the next cleanup pass.

### Proper Logging Framework
Replace println() calls with Napier or similar KMP logging library. Production crashes and errors are currently invisible.
- Effort: S (CC: ~1 hour)
- Context: TabsViewModel.kt:229,244 use println() for error logging.

### Full Analytics Dashboard
Expand basic 3-event logging to a proper analytics solution (Mixpanel, Amplitude, or Supabase dashboard).
- Effort: M (CC: ~1 day)
- Depends on: Basic analytics events being in place first.

### GAS Stale Record Cleanup
After switching to UPSERT, exhibitions deleted from the Google Sheet stay in Supabase. Add `last_synced_at` column and periodic cleanup of records not seen in recent syncs.
- Effort: S (CC: ~1 hour)
- Context: UPSERT fixes the destructive sync issue but introduces stale data risk.
