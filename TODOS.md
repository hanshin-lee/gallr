# TODOS

Last updated: 2026-08-23. Revalidate external service and release status before
acting on older operational entries.

## P1 — Post-Launch

### Commercialize Gallery Launch Kit after beta evidence
Keep free exhibition publication unchanged and run RSVP, QR, guest-list, and
check-in as a bounded beta before choosing a paid package. Do not restore the
retired Stripe checkout/webhook implementation as a shortcut.

- Evidence gate: measure gallery activation, RSVP completion, door check-in
  reliability, support burden, and repeat use without treating public page-load
  counts as billing-grade analytics.
- Policy gate: approve purchase terms, refund/support behavior, guest-data
  retention/deletion/export, incident response, and treatment of existing
  `free_beta` entitlements before collecting payment.
- Product decision: choose which later outcomes are paid (for example promotion,
  richer reports, or a per-exhibition Launch Pass) while keeping organic
  discovery and editorial Featured independent.
- Implementation: create a new spec, provider contract, additive entitlement
  migration, staging rehearsal, and narrow pilot. Payment credentials and live
  provider changes remain separate external approvals stored through 1Password.

### Complete the Supabase legacy API-key migration before the end of 2026
Supabase is deprecating the JWT-based `anon` and `service_role` keys by the end of 2026. The
repository now prefers publishable-key configuration names on mobile and public web and accepts the
replacement publishable/secret key formats. Lower-priority compatibility fallbacks, rehearsal
tooling, and some Edge Functions retain legacy names until deployed environments and older mobile
builds are proven migrated.

- Effort: M (authorized operator + repository cleanup)
- Migration: Inventory every production/staging client and server consumer; create separate
  publishable and component-scoped secret keys; update the matching 1Password items and deployment
  configuration one environment at a time; then verify browser, mobile, Auth/RLS, Edge Functions,
  scheduled jobs, CI, and cutover tooling.
- Compatibility gate: Account for already-installed mobile versions before disabling legacy keys.
  Supabase provides no automatic usage indicator, so record explicit evidence that no supported
  client or integration still uses them and retain an approved rollback path.
- Cleanup scope: Remove the remaining lower-priority `*_ANON_KEY` configuration,
  `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` resolution, fallback tests, and current-guide
  references; require the named publishable/secret key maps in hosted functions.
  Preserve immutable migrations and historical release records.
- External change: Disabling the legacy keys is a separately authorized, reversible Dashboard/API
  operation. Confirm the exact project and environment before changing it; never copy credentials
  between production and staging.
- 2026-08-09 evidence: The Supabase account exposes Seoul production
  (`oqrvbstopuppznxqoonp`), retained Singapore compatibility (`yhuhjxswjbrtmbpbrciq`), and an
  unrelated project; the worktree is intentionally unlinked. 1Password access succeeds. Seoul and
  Singapore retain the platform `default` publishable/secret pair plus enabled legacy keys. Seoul
  now also has production-only `delete_account` publishable/secret keys for the deployed account
  deletion function; both are stored in separate 1Password items. Other components still use the
  default or compatibility keys. Vercel Admin and Gallery use publishable-key variable names.
  Public web production is `canonical-v2`; `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` now contains the Seoul
  publishable key, the deployed compatibility `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` value was replaced with the same
  key and narrowed to production only, and a fresh production deployment plus public smoke checks
  passed. Keep the deprecated name only until the already-implemented preferred-name reader reaches
  `main`; deleting it before that deployment would break the next automatic build. No Supabase
  legacy key has been disabled. The local product guard now covers all 11 Edge Functions, including
  mandatory gateway JWT verification for `delete-account`; all function, Admin, Gallery, Web, KMP,
  Android, and iOS gates pass. Final key retirement still requires the preferred readers to ship and
  supported installed clients to age out.
- 2026-08-11 preview evidence: Seoul has a dedicated `public_web_preview` publishable key stored in
  a separate 1Password item. Vercel now supplies `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, and the
  `canonical-v2` reader to every public-web Preview branch; temporary PR #156 and PR #160 overrides
  were removed after the all-Preview baseline passed live builds from 322 exhibitions. Preview no
  longer defines or accepts the deprecated `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` name. Production's compatibility
  variable remains intentionally gated on the publishable-only reader reaching `main`; Supabase's
  platform legacy keys remain enabled for supported installed clients and other documented
  consumers.

### Push Notifications
Weekly "N new exhibitions near you" push via FCM (Android) + APNs (iOS). Primary retention mechanism. Needs a reviewed server-side scheduler and delivery worker; do not revive the retired Apps Script pipeline. Depends on basic analytics being in place.
- Effort: M (human) → S (CC: ~1 day)
- Context: Design doc identifies retention as key initiative. Without a trigger, users forget to open the app.

## P3 — Technical Debt

### Full Analytics Dashboard
Expand basic 3-event logging to a proper analytics solution (Mixpanel, Amplitude, or Supabase dashboard).
- Effort: M (CC: ~1 day)
- Depends on: Basic analytics events being in place first.

### Debounce public-site rebuilds triggered by the outbox
`outbox-delivery` POSTs the Vercel deploy hook once per `exhibition.published`,
`exhibition.archived`, and `exhibition.restored` event. Now that those builds
actually run, a heavy staff editing session queues one full Eleventy build plus
Supabase fetch per event. Steady state is fine; bursts are wasteful.
- Effort: S (CC: ~1h)
- Options: coalesce events in the function over a short window, or move the hook
  POST behind a scheduled drain instead of a per-event fire.
- Noticed on: shin/gallr-gallery-publish-error-464c65 while investigating the
  cancelled rebuild that made newly published exhibitions 404 (fixed in #228).
